# Week 7

This week, our team has made significant progress in our graduation project. Here is a summary of our work in different project stages, showcasing our plan execution and achievements.

**a) Conceptual Design (End: 2023.10.31)**

    Conduct market research and define user requirements.

    Develop preliminary design sketches and technical programs.

    Build a small prototype for validation.

**b) Mechanical Design (End: 2024.2.29)**

    Based on the conceptual design, determine the joints and drive modes.
    
    Refine the exterior and interior structural design of the robot.
    
    Conduct simulation tests using finite element analysis software to verify the stability and durability of the design.

**c) Electronic Design (End: 2024.4.15)**

    Select appropriate controllers, sensors, and actuators.

    Design the main control board and integrate all sensors and actuators.

    Test electronic systems for stability and compatibility.

**d) Software Development (End: 2024.4.15)**

    Select or customize operating systems and development frameworks.
    
    Develop control algorithms, path planning, and visual recognition systems for the robot.
    
    Design user-friendly interfaces and establish communication protocols with hardware.
   
    Perform unit testing and fix possible software bugs.

**e) Integration & Testing (Ends: 2024.4.30)**

    Integrate mechanical, electronic, and software systems into a complete robot.
    
    Test in real-world environments, such as swamps, wetlands, etc.
   
    Debug the performance of the robot to ensure that the design requirements are met.

**f) Subsequent Optimization (End: 2024.5.30)**

    Make system adjustments and optimizations based on test results.
    
    Add more features or improve existing features.
